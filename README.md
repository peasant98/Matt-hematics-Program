# Matt-hematics-Program
A fairly simple project in C++ that heavily uses the srand() and rand() in order to test people's basic mathematical skills and receive points for correct answers.

A user can supply custom mathematics questions in a text file and well as users' names. From here, the Mathematics Program will ask these questions as well as random questions about addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
